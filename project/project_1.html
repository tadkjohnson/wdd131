        <p> This is the club people go if they enjoy a good game. You can watch, you can learn, you can participate, and
            you can take part. If you enjoy a good game, good people, and good times, come on out and join us.</p>
        <p>We play taple top games this includes: Dungeon & Dragons, Magic The Gathering, Pokemon, Wingspan, Munchkin,
            Dominion, Marvel, Starwars, Startrek, HeroScape, Warhammer: 40,000, Warhammer: Fantasy Battle, SmallWorld,
            Ticket to Ride, Talisman, Azul, Splendor, Settlers of Catan, and a few thousand more. Just to name a few.
        </p>
        <img src="placeholder" alt="diff game" width="200">
        <p>You will notice most of the games are among friends, we talk, we banter, we help each other, it is a casual
            game, where the primary object is to have fun. If your into serious games, there are tournements, which have
            minimal fees, are fun as well, but are for the serious minded folks.</p>
        <p>People will wonder who is invited. We solemnly say everyone is invited, come one and come all. The more the
            merrier. Most games are simple 2-3 players, but many can handle 5-7 players. People show up we will
            accomodate. There are those that like to teach, and those that like to watch, but there is always a empty
            chair for future gamers.</p>
