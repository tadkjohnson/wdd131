            <h2>Purpose of a gaming club</h2>
            <div>
                <p>A place to gather that enjoy gaming on a table top. None are exluded, but video gamers will find
                    difficulties as we dont have that kind of a set up. We are a Table Top Gaming Club. We play games on
                    a
                    table top. </p>
                <p>Our group of people are never the same ones, but are simply the type that spend there time imaging
                    another life, another world, or being a hero in a world of thier making. We spend weekends at a
                    local
                    game shop battling, talking, laughing, and having a good time. During the week, outside of work or
                    school, we maybe found gaming with our familys, finding and trying new games. All are welcome to
                    join
                    us. </p>
                <p>The purpose of our club is to provide a place where all can play, feel welcome, and have a good time.
                    The
                    club will provide instruction if you want to learn a specific game, or provide a place for you to
                    watch and
                    learn.</p>
