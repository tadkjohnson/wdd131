                <p>My name is Tad Johnson. I currently live in Trenton, Tennessee. My family moved here last year from
                    Salt
                    Lake
                    City, for a mountain of reasons. I have three children, ages 21, 13, and 8 years old. My oldest
                    daughter
                    still lives in Utah, but the other two reside with my wife and I. The move to Tennessee, wasn't
                    easy, but it
                    was well worth it to be able to watch our kids grow up and finally feel safe. Prior to me meeting
                    thier mother
                    there was some scary incidents that they had to suffer through, and now they are in a new and safe
                    place. As for me,
                    I have always wanted to learn how to program and develop web pages, and so here I am following my
                    dream. I
                    have worked around computers (building, fixing, repairing) since 1997, but was busy playing cop
                    until 2015. In 2016,
                    I obtained employment at a local hospital working in desktop support, have since obtained a few
                    certificates, but
                    now have the ability to starting learning and following my dream. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Here is a picture of my backyard here in Tennessee. Not a mountin in sight, but moving from Utah,
                    where you could
                    stand on the roof and see nothing but houses in every direction. The population in my new city is
                    less than the population
                    that lived within my ward boundries in Utah. Here That is just one of the perks of moving here.
